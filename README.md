This is an archive site for the course NMA958.

Maintenance and updates are most active during course iterations, which run in even-year winters (22,24,26...). 

It is not (yet?) organzied to be fluidly stand alone instructional -- its more referencial. 

The course archives specifically do have their own logic and order (this isnot to claim that those orders are useful).
