2024 --- leap day pong

TO DO :
-- give everyone a player number -- p1 ..p27

-- have them upload their code but keep controlers off until 2 games before.

-- use the p5 interface to switch players not student code. -- make it a drop down! each side then simply selects?  have the drop down populate with 1-30 on each side

--  set up a test game on a laptop ? 

-- get teh game online ?

DONE for 2024:
-- some of the connectivity glitches came from having a second player connect into a single player game.  since P2 doesn't exist, messages for p2 caused crashes -- currently solved with if/then in player code blocks from message arrival, name display etc. 

-- should split the action from the reception function in MQTT listen.

-- added color selector
